android studio projects 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sharing some of the projects/assignments of "Android Basics Nanodegree" at Udacity - (Jan-Sept 2016) => Maybe assets like pictures might not be stored in the folder, but the code is there and should work when running virtual device in Android Studio.

I could learn java basics as well as XML and understand basics on how an app is designed, and how complex and challenging this can be (prepare pseudocode and structure it, DB's handling, API's calls, eastethics design, assure functionality and speed, debug process, etc.).

Some of the projects herein shared would be:

- Soccer counter => easy to use digital score for a football match, that would display different information during the game.
- Clapp => design of the "body" of a music App; included multiples views design and assure transitions between them through buttons.
- TourEiffel => practicing fragments for app design, to display interesting information of a city
- GuardianAppNews => calls to TheGuardian API to show a news feed and make requests/searches
