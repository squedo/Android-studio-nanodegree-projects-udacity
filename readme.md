Android studio projects (Jan-Sept 2016)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sharing some of the projects/assignments of "Android Basics Nanodegree" at Udacity - (Jan-Sept 2016) => Maybe assets like pictures might not be stored in the folders, but the code is there and should work when running it for a virtual device in Android Studio.

I could learn java and XML basics and understand basics on how an app is designed, and how complex this can be: prepare pseudocode and structure it before coding phase, DB's handling, API's calls, eastethics design, assure functionality at an adequate speed, debug process, quality testings etc. Since then I think I'm aware of how challenging it might be to assure smooth functioning of Apps we find available.

Some of the projects herein shared would be:

- Soccer counter => easy to use digital score for a football match, that would display different information during the game.
- Clapp => design of the "body" of a music App; included multiples views design and assure transitions between them through buttons.
- TourEiffel => practicing fragments for app design, to display interesting information of a city.
- GuardianAppNews => calls to TheGuardian API to show a news feed and make requests/searches.
